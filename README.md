## GitHub WYSIWYG Rich-Text Editor

GitHub Writer is a WYSIWYG rich-text editor for GitHub. The extension is available when creating or commenting on issues, reviews, pull requests, and wikis. 

It provides all the features available in the GitHub plain-text editor, including Markdown input. For features like tables, it offers a much easier experience in comparison to plain-text Markdown and allows users to be more productive.
